- âœŒ Hi, Iâ€™m Tibo, nice to meet you !
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, video games and more recently, in the vast and colorful world of digital development !
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to become a web developer and it's pretty awesome all the possibilites the different coding languages have to offer. I just obtained my diploma !ðŸ¥‡ Iâ€™m aware 
I still have much to go on before becoming an experienced developer. 
- ðŸ““ Iâ€™m looking to learn as much as I can from others and will put some of my projects in here in order to show my work and also to have a clear view on my personal evolution during the years to come. 
I know that most of my work for now probably (itâ€™s even obvious) will not be the most optimized or perfect code examples that exists so donâ€™t hesitate to tell me the real awful things you will see in there and to share so that I can learn from my mistakes ðŸ˜Š
